1. Distributed web infrastructure design

We are adding two more servers to add to the amount fo traffic that the web app can
handle they each have their own web servers and databases
We are also adding one load balancer to distrubuted the traffic across the three
different web servers

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works

The load balancer has many algorithms but the most common one is a Dynamic Round Robin.
This algorithm distributes traffic to each server based on different weights.  These
weights can then be updated at any time for optimal traffic routing.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both.

The web infrastructure for number one is using an Active Active configuration which means
that each server is running at the same time, where as active-passive is set up where
every client is requesting the same server.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
Enables data from one database server to be replicated to one or more other database
servers.  The master is the one that is replicated and the slave is the one taht is being
copied to

What is the difference between the Primary node and replica node in regards to the 
application?
The primary node is the one that writes to the database and the replica nodes do not

SPOF:  In this distributed web infrastructure teh single point of failure is the load
balancer which routes traffic to all the servers
Security Issues: No https which means this is not encrpyted data and there is no firewall
monitoring in person traffic
