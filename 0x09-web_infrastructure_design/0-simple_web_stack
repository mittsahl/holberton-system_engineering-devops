Issues:
SPOF: Single point of failure, meaning that there is only one set up behind the scenes
of the website or web app.  If it fails, thats a wrap, it is no longer working properly
Downtime for maintainence:  Again, there is only one set up running the site/app, so if
you need to restart for maintainence, then it is not working for a period of time.
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:  If the site or app becomes too big, there
is nothing that can be done to scale the size or usablility of the app if the server
gets overloaded
